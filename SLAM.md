## Trade off

extropolator: pose only / odometry / correlative scan match

scan match: hit only / hit+miss matching?

Different purpose: pure localization / online SLAM / offline mapping

Scan frequency: 20HZ?

## TODO

Rviz config: view submaps when running

Odometry: bicycle or rear differential?

Pure localization

Image registration



# Lane graph extraction

GVD: may use boost and merge linesegments?

Solver: use Ceres instead of own code?
